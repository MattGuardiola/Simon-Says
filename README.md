## How to Play

The Simon game is a classic memory game that requires players to memorize and repeat a specific sequence of colors. The game consists of four colored buttons: green, red, yellow, and blue.

The game will play a sequence of colors, and you must repeat the sequence by clicking the buttons in the correct order. Each time you successfully repeat the sequence, the game will add another color to the sequence, making it progressively more difficult.

If you click the wrong color or miss a color in the sequence, the game will end and you will have to start over at the beginning.
